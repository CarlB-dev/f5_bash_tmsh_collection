The stats are collected since the device was last booted or manually cleared if my memory is correct.  With that, we can look at the uptime to assume how long the system has been collecting statistics that are returned.

This command is designed to gather detailed information about the virtual servers configured on a BIG-IP system, including their destination, availability, state, network traffic stats, and CPU usage, and then format and sort this information for easy readability. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the command:

```bash
tmsh -q -c 'cd /; show sys failover; show ltm virtual raw recursive' | (
    echo "Virtual_Server Destination Availability State Bits_In Bits_Out CPU_Last_5s CPU_Last_1m CPU_Last_5m" &&
    awk '/Ltm::Virtual/ {printf $3" "} /Destination/ {printf $3 " "} /Availability/ {printf $3 " "} /State/ {printf $3" "} /Bits In/ {printf $3 " "} /Bits Out/ {printf $3 " "} /Last 5 Seconds/ {printf $4 " "} /Last 1 Minute/ {printf $4 " "} /Last 5 Minutes/ {printf $4 "\n"}'
) | column -t | awk 'NR==1; NR>1 {print $0 | "sort -nr -k5"}'
```

### Explanation:

1. **`tmsh -q -c 'cd /; show sys failover; show ltm virtual raw recursive'`**:
    - `tmsh -q -c`: Runs the Traffic Management Shell (tmsh) in quiet mode and executes the commands within the quotes.
    - `cd /`: Navigates to the root directory.
    - `show sys failover`: Displays the failover status of the system.
    - `show ltm virtual raw recursive`: Displays detailed information about all virtual servers, including their configurations and statistics, recursively.

2. **`| ( echo "Virtual_Server Destination Availability State Bits_In Bits_Out CPU_Last_5s CPU_Last_1m CPU_Last_5m" && awk ... )`**:
    - The pipe (`|`) sends the output of the `tmsh` command to a subshell.
    - `echo "Virtual_Server Destination Availability State Bits_In Bits_Out CPU_Last_5s CPU_Last_1m CPU_Last_5m"`: Prints the header row for the output.
    - `&&`: Ensures that the header is printed before processing the rest of the output with `awk`.

3. **`awk '...'`**: Processes the `tmsh` output to extract and format the relevant information:
    - `/Ltm::Virtual/ {printf $3" "}`: When the line contains "Ltm::Virtual", print the third field (virtual server name) followed by a space.
    - `/Destination/ {printf $3 " "}`: When the line contains "Destination", print the third field (destination IP and port) followed by a space.
    - `/Availability/ {printf $3 " "}`: When the line contains "Availability", print the third field (availability status) followed by a space.
    - `/State/ {printf $3" "}`: When the line contains "State", print the third field (state) followed by a space.
    - `/Bits In/ {printf $3 " "}`: When the line contains "Bits In", print the third field (bits in) followed by a space.
    - `/Bits Out/ {printf $3 " "}`: When the line contains "Bits Out", print the third field (bits out) followed by a space.
    - `/Last 5 Seconds/ {printf $4 " "}`: When the line contains "Last 5 Seconds", print the fourth field (CPU usage in the last 5 seconds) followed by a space.
    - `/Last 1 Minute/ {printf $4 " "}`: When the line contains "Last 1 Minute", print the fourth field (CPU usage in the last minute) followed by a space.
    - `/Last 5 Minutes/ {printf $4 "\n"}`: When the line contains "Last 5 Minutes", print the fourth field (CPU usage in the last 5 minutes) followed by a newline to end the row.

4. **`| column -t`**:
    - The pipe (`|`) sends the processed data to the `column` command.
    - `column -t`: Formats the output into a table with aligned columns for better readability.

5. **`| awk 'NR==1; NR>1 {print $0 | "sort -nr -k5"}'`**:
    - The pipe (`|`) sends the formatted table to another `awk` command.
    - `NR==1`: Prints the first row (header) as is.
    - `NR>1 {print $0 | "sort -nr -k5"}`: For all subsequent rows, sends the output to the `sort` command.
        - `sort -nr -k5`: Sorts the rows numerically (`-n`) in reverse order (`-r`) based on the fifth column (Bits_In).

This command effectively consolidates and formats the virtual server information, and sorts it by the amount of incoming traffic (`Bits_In`), providing a clear and organized view.

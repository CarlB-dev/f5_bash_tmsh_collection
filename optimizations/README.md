# Optimization Scripts

Welcome to the **Optimization Scripts** repository! This repository contains two essential scripts to help manage and optimize your F5 BIG-IP virtual server configurations. Each script is tailored to streamline specific tasks related to identifying and replacing outdated `tcp` profiles on virtual servers. Below, you'll find a brief description of each script and links to their respective README files for more detailed information.

## 1. Script: Discovery/Inventory for Virtual Servers with Legacy TCP Profile

This script is designed to **identify and inventory** all virtual servers on your F5 BIG-IP system that are still using the legacy `tcp { }` profile. It is particularly useful for change management processes, as it provides a list of servers that may need configuration updates.

Additionally, the script notes if any virtual server names include `.app`, which indicates that they are managed by an iApp template. For such servers, strict updates must be disabled before making profile changes.

## 2. Script: Replace Default TCP Profile with Optimized F5 Profiles

This script automates the process of replacing the legacy `tcp { }` profile on F5 BIG-IP virtual servers with the optimized profiles:
- `f5-tcp-wan` for **client-side** traffic.
- `f5-tcp-lan` for **server-side** traffic.

Using this script ensures that your virtual servers are configured with profiles optimized for WAN and LAN traffic, improving network performance and throughput.

## Backup and Precautions

No matter which script you use, we recommend backing up your F5 BIG-IP system configuration before making any changes. Use the following command to create a UCS backup file:
```shell
tmsh save sys ucs /var/local/ucs/backup.ucs
```

Always test the scripts in a development or staging environment to verify their compatibility with your setup before deploying in production.

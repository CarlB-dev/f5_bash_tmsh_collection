# f5_bash_tmsh_collection
Public repository of bash/tmsh commands to find and change/delete objects

The first library of commands stems from my work to write https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000149084 
There will likely be a DevCentral Article that explains a lot of this as well from a less specific use case so that others may adapt it to their needs.
A companion article to this is on DevCentral - https://community.f5.com/kb/technicalarticles/using-bash-and-tmsh-to-make-bulk-updates/339473

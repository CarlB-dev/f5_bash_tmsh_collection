# F5 Bash and TMSH Command Collection

This repository contains a public collection of Bash and TMSH commands designed to help users find, change, and delete objects within F5 systems. 

The first set of commands originates from efforts to write [related work](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000149084). I wrote a companion article on DevCentral that explains these commands in detail for more general use cases, allowing others to adapt them to their specific needs.
